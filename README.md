# Shop Demo App

A simple demo app for a shop application, using the following:
- React
- Redux
- ImmutableJS
- Redux Thunk
- CSS Modules
- Webpack, Babel

## Running the app

To run the app, first clone the repo.

```bash
mkdir shop-demo && cd shop-demo
git clone https://github.com/koriner/react-shop-demo.git .
```

Install dependencies and run the dev server

```bash
# If you don't have yarn, install it first
npm install -g yarn

yarn

yarn run start
```

## Notes

The production build isn't really set up (but it would probably work) so this is only tested to run in development mode.
